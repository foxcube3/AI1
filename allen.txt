PREFACE


T he subject of this book has been "in the air" for at least thirty years, and during this time there has been an ever- growing discussion of this or that parallel between Western psychotherapy and Eastern philosophy. But thus far no one has attempted, comprehensively, to find some basic design common to the methods and objectives of psychotherapy, on the one hand, and the disciplines of Buddhism, Vedanta, Yoga, and Taoism, on the other. The latter are not, perhaps, psychotherapies in the strict sense, but there is enough resemblance to make the comparison important.

The discussion seems to have begun in the early 1930s, following such works as Richard Wilhelm's translation of a Chinese text, The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a long psychological commentary by C. G. Jung (1929), G. R. Heyer's Der Organismus der Seele (1932), and Geraldine Coster's Yoga and Western Psychology (1934). I have been deeply interested in this fruitful interchange between East and West almost from its beginnings. I also made some contribution to it in a rather immature book called The Legacy of Asia and Western Man (1937), and a little later in The Meaning of Happiness (1940), which bore the subtitle "The Quest for Freedom of the Spirit in Modern Psychology and in the Wisdom of the East." At that time, almost the only form of psychotherapy which was thus "oriented" was the Jungian. But subsequent developments both in psychotherapy and in our knowledge of Eastern thought have made it possible for us to make much wider and more suggestive comparisons. The same period has also seen an astonishing growth of Western interest in Eastern ways of life, particularly in Zen Buddhism, and the latest contribution to this interchange is the collaboration of Erich Fromm and D. T. Suzuki in Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis (1960). My purpose in writing this book is not, however, to sum up or review the development of this discussion. It is rather to give it a new turn. Before the writing began, I saw that there were two main ways of handling the subject. Since I have read almost everything that has been written about it, I saw that I could weave all this material into a kind of critical history of psychiatric interest in Eastern thought, combined with a point-by-point comparison of all the major forms of psychotherapy and all the principal techniques of the Eastern disciplines. But this would have produced an unwieldy volume of rather academic interest; furthermore, such formal studies are not my forte, and I leave them very gladly to those who have the necessary patience and industry. The other way was to describe what I feel to be the most fruitful way in which Eastern and Western psychotherapies can fertilize one another. For not only have they much to learn from each other, but also it seems to me that the comparison brings out hidden and highly important aspects of both. I decided, therefore, to write not a compendium of sober conclusions, but a provocative essay which may jolt both parties to the discussion. For I feel that both are fumbling in the dark, though not without some light. Wonderful as I have found them, I do not believe that the Eastern disciplines are the last word in sacrosanct and immemorial wisdom such that the world must come and sit humbly at the feet of their masters. Nor do I feel that there is a gospel according to Freud, or to Jung, in which the great psychological truths are forever fixed. The aim of this book is not to say the last word on the subject, but to provoke thought and experiment.

My chosen approach to the subject does, however, have the disadvantage of not being able to give adequate mention to all the people who have influenced my thinking, or sufficient recognition to all who have contributed to the discussion. Conversations that were held and books that were read long ago become so much a part of the stream of one's own thinking that it is impossible, sometimes, to say which ideas are one's own and which are borrowed. This book does not therefore make explicit what may have come from my early reading of such speculative and adventurous therapists as Trigant Burrow, Georg Groddeck, and my friend Eric Graham Howe. It does not specify what I have gained over the years from discussion of its main theme with Professor Frederic Spiegelberg, of Stanford University, or with Dr. Lillian Baker and the late Dr. Charles G. Taylor, both Jungian analysts. Nor does it acknowledge the contributions which have been made to the subject by Medard Boss, Hubert Benoit, Henry Dicks, and Lili Abegg, in Europe; by Shoma Morita, Takehisa Kora, and Akihisa Kondo, in Japan; or by Karen Horney, Harold Kellman, Joseph Campbell, Margaret Rioch, and many others, in the United States.

But the reader will quickly recognize, in the book's underlying philosophy of the universe as organic and transactional, my debt to A. N. Whitehead, Joseph Needham, L. L. Whyte, A. F. Bentley, and the Gestalt psychologists. If he has read my other books, he will also see the more recent influence of what I must call, to distinguish them from the neo-Freudians like Horney and Fromm, the "meta-Freudians" Norman O. Brown and Herbert Marcuse. He will also note my increasing respect for the "communication psychology" of Gregory Bateson and his associates, particularly Jay Haley, which goes hand in hand with my growing preference for discussing these matters in a language that is more scientific and less metaphysical.

He will find, therefore, that I place more weight upon the connection of the Eastern disciplines with forms of psychotherapy whose philosophy is social, interpersonal, and communicational than with those which stress "the unconscious" and its archetypal images. Even though the discussion of this interchange between East and West has so largely been carried on by those who follow the latter trend, I cannot help feeling that it is becoming more and more of a backwater in the development of Western psychiatry, despite the debt which we shall always owe to Freud. Psychoanalysis in particular and "depth psychology" in general seem to me to be increasingly out of touch with all that has been going on in the sciences of human behavior during the last thirty years,
and many of us are wondering seriously how long it will be
possible for psychology, the study of an alleged psyche, to remain a department of science.

In addition to the influences mentioned above, this book
has not been prepared without a great deal of discussion with
persons actively engaged in psychotherapy. During the past
few years I have had the privilege of conducting seminars
upon its subject and of being a guest lecturer at many medical
schools, hospitals, and psychiatric institutes — including the
Yale Medical School, the Langley-Porter Clinic of the
University of California, the C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich, the
Washington School of Psychiatry, the Palo Alto Veterans'
Hospital, the Stanford Medical School, and many state
psychiatric hospitals. My thanks are due to all those
responsible for these opportunities.

I. PSYCHOTHERAPY AND LIBERATION


f we look deeply into such ways of life as Buddhism and Taoism, Vedanta and Yoga, we do not find either philosophy or religion as these are understood in the West. We find something more nearly resembling psychotherapy. This may seem surprising, for we think of the latter as a form of science, somewhat practical and materialistic in attitude, and of the former as extremely esoteric religions concerned with regions of the spirit almost entirely out of this world. This is because the combination of our unfamiliarity with Eastern cultures and their sophistication gives them an aura of mystery into which we project fantasies of our own making. Yet the basic aim of these ways of life is something of quite astonishing simplicity, besides which all the complications of reincarnation and psychic powers, of superhuman mahatmas, and of schools for occult technology are a smoke screen in which the credulous inquirer can lose himself indefinitely. In fairness it should be added that the credulous inquirer may be Asian as well as Western, though the former has seldom the peculiarly highbrow credulity of the Western fancier of esotericism. The smoke is beginning to clear, but for a long time its density has hidden the really important contributions of the Eastern mind to psychological knowledge.

The main resemblance between these Eastern ways of life and Western psychotherapy is in the concern of both with bringing about changes of consciousness, changes in our ways of feeling our own existence and our relation to human society and the natural world. The psychotherapist has, for the most part, been interested in changing the consciousness of peculiarly disturbed individuals. The disciplines of Buddhism and Taoism are, however, concerned with changing the consciousness of normal, socially adjusted people. But it is increasingly apparent to psychotherapists that the normal state of consciousness in our culture is both the context and the breeding ground of mental disease. A complex of societies of vast material wealth bent on mutual destruction is anything but
a condition of social health.

Nevertheless, the parallel between psychotherapy and, as I
have called them,1 the Eastern "ways of liberation" is not
exact, and one of the most important differences is suggested
by the prefix psycho-. Historically, Western psychology has
directed itself to the study of the psyche, or mind, as a clinical
entity, whereas Eastern cultures have not categorized mind and
matter, soul and body, in the same way as the Western. But
Western psychology has to some extent so outgrown its
historical origins as to become dissatisfied with the very term
"psychological" as describing a major field of human
behavior. It is not that it has become possible, as Freud himself
once hoped, to reduce psychology to neurology and mind to
body. It is not that for the entity "mind" we can substitute the
entity "nervous system." It is rather that psychology cannot
stand aloof from the whole revolution in scientific description
which has been going on in the twentieth century, a revolution
in which conceptions of entities and "stuffs," whether mental
or material, have become obsolete. Whether it is describing
chemical changes or biological forms, nuclear structures or
human behavior, the language of modern science is simply
concerned with changing patterns of relationship.

Perhaps this revolution has affected physics and biology
far more deeply than psychology and as yet the theoretical
ideas of psychoanalysis remain untouched. The common
speech and the common sense of even educated society has
been so little affected that it is still hard to convey in some
nonmathematical language what has happened. It seems an
affront to common sense that we can describe the world as
patterns of relationship without needing to ask what "stuff"
these patterns are "made of." For when the scientist
investigates matter or stuff, he describes what he finds in terms
of structured pattern. When one comes to think of it, what
other terms could he use? The sensation of stuff arises only
when we are confronted with patterns so confused or so
closely knit that we cannot make them out. To the naked eye a distant galaxy looks like a solid star and a piece of steel like a continuous and impenetrable mass of matter. But when we change the level of magnification, the galaxy assumes the clear structure of a spiral nebula and the piece of steel turns out to be a system of electrical impulses whirling in relatively vast spaces. The idea of stuff expresses no more than the experience of coming to a limit at which our senses or our instruments are not fine enough to make out the pattern.

Something of the same kind happens when the scientist investigates any unit of pattern so distinct to the naked eye that it has been considered a separate entity. He finds that the more carefully he observes and describes it, the more he is also describing the environment in which it moves and other patterns to which it seems inseparably related. As Teilhard de Chardin has so well expressed it,2 the isolation of individual, atomic patterns "is merely an intellectual dodge."

Considered in its physical, concrete reality, the stuff [sic] of the universe cannot divide itself but, as a kind of gigantic "atom," it forms in its totality... the only real indivisible....The farther and more deeply we penetrate into matter, by means of increasingly powerful methods, the more we are confounded by the interdependence of its parts.... It is impossible to cut into this network, to isolate a portion without it becoming frayed and unravelled at all its edges.

In place of the inarticulate cohesion of mere stuff we find the articulate cohesion of inseparably interconnected patterns.

The effect of this upon the study of human behavior is that it becomes impossible to separate psychological patterns from patterns that are sociological, biological, or ecological. Departments of knowledge based upon what now appear to be crude and primitive divisions of nature begin to coalesce into such awkwardly named hybrids as neuropsychiatry, sociobiology, biophysics, and geopolitics. At a certain depth of specialization the divisions of scientific knowledge begin to run together because they are far enough advanced to see that the world itself runs together, however clear-cut its parts may
have seemed to be. Hence the ever-increasing discussion of the
need for a "unified science" and for a descriptive language
common to all departments of science. Hence, too, the
growing importance of the very science of description, of
communication, of the patterns of signs and signals, which
represents and elucidates the pattern of the world.

Although the ancient cultures of Asia never attained the
rigorously exact physical knowledge of the modern West, they
grasped in principle many things which are only now
occurring to us.3 Hinduism and Buddhism are impossible to
classify as religions, philosophies, sciences, or even
mythologies, or again as amalgamations of all four, because
departmentalization is foreign to them even in so basic a form
as the separation of the spiritual and the material. Hinduism,
like Islam and Judaism, is really a whole culture, though the
same cannot be said of Buddhism. Buddhism, in common with
such aspects of Hinduism as Vedanta and Yoga, and with
Taoism in China, is not a culture but a critique of culture, an
enduring nonviolent revolution, or "loyal opposition," to the
culture with which it is involved. This gives these ways of
liberation something in common with psychotherapy beyond
the interest in changing states of consciousness. For the task of
the psychotherapist is to bring about a reconciliation between
individual feeling and social norms without, however,
sacrificing the integrity of the individual. He tries to help the
individual to be himself and to go it alone without giving
unnecessary offense to his community, to be in the world (of
social convention) but not of the world. A Chinese Buddhist
text describes the sage in words that strongly suggest
Riesman's "inner-directed" or Maslow's "self-actualizing"
personality:

He walks always by himself, goes about always by
himself;

Every perfect one saunters along one and the same
passage of Nirvana; His tone is classical, his spirit is transparent, his airs

are naturally elevated,

His features are rather gaunt, his bones are firm, he

pays no attention to others. 4

From Freud onward, psychotherapy has been concerned

with the violence done to the human organism and its

functions by social repression. Whenever the therapist stands

with society, he will interpret his work as adjusting the

individual and coaxing his "unconscious drives" into social

respectability. But such "official psychotherapy" lacks

integrity and becomes the obedient tool of armies,

bureaucracies, churches, corporations, and all agencies that

require individual brainwashing. On the other hand, the

therapist who is really interested in helping the individual is

forced into social criticism. This does not mean that he has to

engage directly in political revolution; it means that he has to

help the individual in liberating himself from various forms of

social conditioning, which includes liberation from hating this

conditioning— hatred being a form of bondage to its object.

But from this point of view the troubles and symptoms from

which the patient seeks relief, and the unconscious factors

behind them, cease to be merely psychological. They lie in the

whole pattern of his relationships with other people and, more

particularly, in the social institutions by which these

relationships are governed: the rules of communication

employed by the culture or group. These include the

conventions of language and law, of ethics and aesthetics, of

status, role, and identity, and of cosmology, philosophy, and

religion. For this whole social complex is what provides the

individual's conception of himself, his state of consciousness,

his very feeling of existence. What is more, it provides the

human organism's idea of its individuality, which can take a

number of quite different forms.

Seeing this, the psychotherapist must realize that his

science, or art, is misnamed, for he is dealing with something

far more extensive than a psyche and its private troubles. This

is just what so many psychotherapists are recognizing and what, at the same time, makes the Eastern ways of liberation
so pertinent to their work. For they are dealing with people
whose distress arises from what may be termed maya, to use
the Hindu-Buddhist word whose exact meaning is not merely
"illusion" but the entire world-conception of a culture,
considered as illusion in the strict etymological sense of a play
(Latin, ludere). The aim of a way of liberation is not the
destruction of maya but seeing it for what it is, or seeing
through it. Play is not to be taken seriously, or, in other words,
ideas of the world and of oneself which are social conventions
and institutions are not to be confused with reality. The rules
of communication are not necessarily the rules of the universe,
and man is not the role or identity which society thrusts upon
him. For when a man no longer confuses himself with the
definition of himself that others have given him, he is at once
universal and unique. He is universal by virtue of the
inseparability of his organism from the cosmos. He is unique
in that he is just this organism and not any stereotype of role,
class, or identity assumed for the convenience of social
communication.

There are many reasons why distress comes from
confusing this social maya with reality. There is direct conflict
between what the individual organism is and what others say it
is and expect it to be. The rules of social communication often
contain contradictions which lead to impossible dilemmas in
thought, feeling, and action. Or it may be that confusion of
oneself with a limiting and impoverished view of one's role or
identity creates feelings of isolation, loneliness, and alienation.
The multitudinous differences between individuals and their
social contexts lead to as many ways of seeking relief from
these conflicts. Some seek it in the psychoses and neuroses
which lead to psychiatric treatment, but for the most part
release is sought in the socially permissible orgies of mass
entertainment, religious fanaticism, chronic sexual titillation,
alcoholism, war — the whole sad list of tedious and barbarous
escapes. Naturally, then, it is being said that the need for psychotherapy goes far beyond that of those who are clinically psychotic or neurotic, and for many years now increasing numbers of people have been receiving psychotherapy who would formerly have sought counsel from a minister of religion or a sympathetic friend. But no one has yet discovered how to apply psychotherapy on a mass basis. Trained therapists exist in a ratio of about one to eight thousand of the population, and the techniques of psychotherapy are lengthy and expensive. Its growing popularity is due in large measure to the prestige of science and thus of the therapist as a scientific rather than religious soul doctor. Yet I know of a few reputable psychiatrists who will not admit, at least in private, that their profession is still far from being a science. To begin with, there is no generally accepted theory or even terminology of the science, but rather a multiplicity of conflicting theories and divergent techniques. Our knowledge of neurology, if this should prove to be the basis of psychiatry, is as yet extremely limited. To make things worse, there is still no clear evidence that psychotherapy is anything more than a hit-or-miss placebo, and, save in the case of psychotic symptoms that can be controlled by certain drugs, there is no sure way of distinguishing its "cures" from spontaneous remission. And some of its techniques, including lobotomy and shock treatment, are nothing but measures of sheer desperation.

Nevertheless, the profession is on the whole a patient and devoted fraternity, receptive to all manner of new ideas and experiments. Even if it does not know what sense to make of it, an enormous amount of detailed information has been collected, and there is a growing realization that, to make any progress, psychiatry must ally itself more closely with neurology and biology on one side and with sociology and anthropology on the other. We must ask, then, to what other milieu in our society we can look for anything to be done about the distress of the individual in his conflict with social institutions which are self-contradictory, obsolete, or needlessly restricting — including, it must be repeated, the current notion of the individual himself, of the skin-
encapsulated ego.

That many people now consult the psychotherapist rather
than the minister is not due simply to the fact that science has
greater prestige than religion. Many Protestant and Jewish theological seminaries include courses of instruction in
"pastoral psychiatry," comprising periods of internship in
mental hospitals. Furthermore, religion has been so liberalized that in all metropolitan and in many rural arcas one has not far
to go to find a minister who will listen to no matter what
individual difficulty with the greatest sympathy and
generosity, and often with considerable intelligence. But what
hinders the minister in resolving conflicts between the
individual and social institutions is precisely his own role. He
represents a church, a community, and almost without
exception religious communities work to establish social
institutions and not to see through them. This is not to say that
most religious groups abstain from social criticism, since this
would be very far from true. Most religious groups oppose
some social institutions quite vigorously, but at the same time
they inculcate others without understanding their conventional
nature. For those which they inculcate they claim the authority
of the will of God or the laws of nature, thus making it
extremely difficult for their members to see that social
institutions are simply rules of communication which have no
more universal validity than, say, the rules of a particular
grammar. Furthermore, however sympathetic the minister of
religion may be, in the back of his mind there is almost always
the desire to bring the individual back into the fold of his
church.

The Jewish-Christian idea of salvation means precisely
membership in a community, the Communion of Saints.
Ideally and theoretically the Church as the Body of Christ is
the entire universe, and because in Christ "there is neither
Greek nor Jew, bond nor free," membership in Christ could
mean liberation from maya and its categories. It could mean
that one's conventional definition and classification is not one's real self, that "I live, yet no longer I; but Christ lives in
me." But in practice it means nothing of the kind, and, for that
matter, one hears little even of the theory. In practice it means
accepting the religion or bondage of the Christian subgroup,
taking its particular system of conventions and definitions to
be the most serious realities. Now one of the most important
Christian conventions is the view of man as what I have called
the "skin-encapsulated ego," the separate soul and its fleshy
vehicle together constituting a personality which is unique and
ultimately valuable in the sight of God. This view is
undoubtedly the historical basis of the Western style of
individuality, giving us the sensation of ourselves as isolated
islands of consciousness confronted with objective
experiences which are quite "other." We have developed this
sensation to a particularly acute degree. But the system of
conventions which inculcates this sensation also requires this
definitively isolated ego to act as the member of a body and to
submit without reserve to the social pattern of the church. The
tension so generated, however interesting at times, is in the
long run as unworkable as any other flat self-contradiction. It
is a perfectly ideal context for breeding psychosis. Yet, as we
shall see, it would also be an ideal context for therapy if
responsible religious leaders were aware of the contradiction
and did not take it seriously. In other words, the minister might
become an extraordinarily helpful person if he could see
through his own religion. But his training and his economic
situation do not encourage him to do so, and therefore the
psychotherapist is in a more advantageous position.

Thus far, then, we have seen that psychotherapy and the
ways of liberation have two interests in common: first, the
transformation of consciousness, of the inner feeling of one's
own existence; and second, the release of the individual from
forms of conditioning imposed upon him by social institutions.
What are the useful means of exploring these resemblances so
as to help the therapist in his work? Should he take practical
instruction in Yoga, or spend time in a Japanese Zen
monastery — adding yet more years of training to medical
school, psychiatric residency, or training analysis? I do not feel that this is the point at all. It is rather that even a theoretical
knowledge of other cultures helps us to understand our own,
because we can attain some clarity and objectivity about our
own social institutions by comparing them with others. It helps
us to distinguish between social fictions, on the one hand, and
natural patterns and relationships, on the other. If, then, there
are in other cultures disciplines having something in common
with psychotherapy, a theoretical knowledge of their methods,
objectives, and principles may enable the psychotherapist to
get a better perspective upon what he himself is doing.

This he needs rather urgently. For we have seen that at the
present time psychology and psychiatry are in a state of great
theoretical confusion. It may sound strange to say that most of
this confusion is due to unconscious factors, for is it not the
particular business of these sciences to understand "the
unconscious"? But the unconscious factors bearing upon
psychotherapy go far beyond the traumas of infancy and the
repressions of anger and sexuality. For example, the
psychotherapist carries on his work with an almost wholly
unexamined "philosophical unconscious." He tends to be
ignorant, by reason of his highly specialized training, not only
of the contemporary philosophy of science but also of the
hidden metaphysical premises which underlie all the main
forms of psychological theory. Unconscious metaphysics tends
to be bad metaphysics. What, then, if the metaphysical
presuppositions of psychoanalysis are invalid, or if its theory
depends on discredited anthropological ideas of the nineteenth
century? Throughout his writings Jung insists again and again
that he speaks as a scientist and physician and not as a
metaphysician. "Our psychology," he writes, "is... a science of
mere phenomena without any metaphysical implications." It
"treats all metaphysical claims and assertions as mental
phenomena, and regards them as statements about the mind
and its structure that derive ultimately from certain
unconscious dispositions."5 But this is a whopping
metaphysical assumption in itself. The difficulty is that man
can hardly think or act at all without some kind of
metaphysical premise, some basic axiom which he can neither verify nor fully define. Such axioms are like the rules of games: some give ground for interesting and fruitful plays and some do not, but it is always important to understand as clearly as possible what the rules are. Thus the rules of tick-tack-toe are not as fruitful as those of chess, and what if the axioms of psychoanalysis resemble the former instead of the latter? Would this not put the science back to the level of mathematics when geometry was only Euclidean?

Unconscious factors in psychotherapy include also the social and ecological contexts of patient and therapist alike, and these tend to be ignored in a situation where two people are closeted together in private. As Norman O. Brown has put it:

There is a certain loss of insight in the tendency of psychoanalysis to isolate the individual from culture. Once we recognize the limitations of talk from the couch, or rather, once we recognize that talk from the couch is still an activity in culture, it becomes plain that there is nothing for the psychoanalyst to analyze except these cultural projections — the world of slums and telegrams and newspapers — and thus psychoanalysis fulfills itself only when it becomes historical and cultural analysis. 6

Is not this a way of saying that what needs to be analyzed or clarified in an individual's behavior is the way in which it reflects the contradictions and confusions of the culture?

Now cultural patterns come to light and hidden metaphysical assumptions become clear only to the degree that we can step outside the cultural or metaphysical systems in which we are involved by comparing them with others. There are those who argue that this is simply impossible, that our impressions of other cultures are always hopelessly distorted by our own conditioning. But this is almost a cultural solipsism, and it is equivalent to saying that we can never really be in communication with another person. If this be true, all study of foreign languages and institutions, and even all discourse with other individuals, is nothing but extending the pattern of one's own ignorance. As a metaphysical
assumption there is no way of disproving it, but it offers
nothing in the way of a fruitful development.

The positive aspect of liberation as it is understood in the
Eastern ways is precisely freedom of play. Its negative aspect
is criticism of premises and rules of the "social game" which
restrict this freedom and do not allow what we have called
fruitful development. The Buddhist Nirvana is defined as
release from samsara, literally the Round of Birth and Death,
that is, from life lived in a vicious circle, as an endlessly
repetitious attempt to solve a false problem. Samsara is
therefore comparable to attempts to square the circle, trisect
the angle, or construct a mechanism of perpetual motion. A
puzzle which has no solution forces one to go over the same
ground again and again until it appears that the question which
it poses is nonsense. This is why the neurotic person keeps
repeating his behavior patterns always unsuccessful
because he is trying to solve a false problem, to make sense of
a self-contradiction. If he cannot see that the problem itself is
nonsense, he may simply retreat into psychosis, into the
paralysis of being unable to act at all. Alternatively, the
"psychotic break" may also be an illegitimate burst into free
play out of sheer desperation, not realizing that the problem is
impossible not because of overwhelming difficulty, but
because it is meaningless.

If, then, there is to be fruitful development in the science
of psychotherapy, as well as in the lives of those whom it
intends to help, it must be released from the unconscious
blocks, unexamined assumptions, and unrealized nonsense
problems which lie in its social context. Again, one of the
most powerful instruments for this purpose is intercultural
comparison, especially with highly complex cultures like the
Chinese and Indian, which have grown up in relative isolation
from our own, and especially with attempts that have been
made within those cultures to find liberation from their own
patterns. It is hard to imagine anything more constructive to
the psychotherapist than the opportunity which this affords. But to make use of it he must overcome the habitual notion
that he has nothing to learn from "prescientific" disciplines,
for in the case of psychotherapy this may be a matter of the pot
calling the kettle black. In any event, there is no question here
of his adopting Buddhist or Taoist practices in the sense of
becoming converted to a religion. If the Westerner is to
understand and employ the Eastern ways of liberation at all, it
is of the utmost importance that he keep his scientific wits
about him; otherwise there is the morass of esoteric
romanticism which awaits the unwary.

But today, past the middle of the twentieth century, there is
no longer much of a problem in advocating a hearing for
Eastern ideas. The existing interest in them is already
considerable, and they are rapidly influencing our thinking by
their own force, even though there remains a need for much
interpretation, clarification, and assimilation. Nor can we
commend their study to psychotherapists as if this were
something altogether new. It is now thirty years since Jung
wrote:

When I began my life-work in the practice of psychiatry
and psychotherapy, I was completely ignorant of Chinese
philosophy, and it is only later that my professional
experiences have shown me that in my technique I had
been unconsciously led along that secret way which for
centuries has been the preoccupation of the best minds of
the East.7

An equivalence between Jung's analytical psychology and the
ways of liberation must be accepted with some reservations,
but it is important that he felt it to exist. Though the interest
began with Jung and his school, suspect among other schools
for its alleged "mysticism," it has gone far beyond, so much so
that it would be a fair undertaking to document the discussions
of Eastern ideas which have appeared in psychological books
and journals during the past few years.*

The level at which Eastern thought and its insights may be
of value to Western psychology has been admirably stated by 

  Gardner Murphy, a psychologist who, incidentally, can hardly be suspected of the taint of Jung's "mysticism." He writes: 



  If, moreover, we are serious about understanding all we can of personality, its integration and disintegration, we must understand the meaning of depersonalization, those experiences in which individual self-awareness is abrogated and the individual melts into an awareness which is no longer anchored upon selfhood. Such experiences are described by Hinduism in terms of the ultimate unification of the individual with the atman, the super-individual cosmic entity which transcends both selfhood and materiality... Some men desire such experiences; others dread them. Our problem here is not their desirability, but the light which they throw on the relativity of our present-day psychology of personality... .Some other mode of personality configuration, in which self-awareness is less emphasized or even lacking, may prove to be the general (or the fundamental).

  It is of course a common misapprehension that the change of personal consciousness effected in the Eastern ways of liberation is "depersonalization" in the sense of regression to a primitive or infantile type of awareness. Indeed, Freud designated the longing for return to the oceanic consciousness of the womb as the Nirvana-principle, and his followers have persistently confused all ideas of transcending the ego with mere loss of "ego strength." This attitude flows, perhaps, from the imperialism of Western Europe in the nineteenth century, when it became convenient to regard Indians and Chinese as backward and benighted heathens desperately in need of improvement by colonization. 


  It cannot be stressed too strongly that liberation does not involve the loss or destruction of such conventional concepts as the ego; it means seeing through them — in the same way that we can use the idea of the equator without confusing it with a physical mark upon the surface of the earth. Instead of falling below the ego, liberation surpasses it. Writing without apparent knowledge of Buddhism or Vedanta, A. F. Bentley

put it thus:

Let no quibble of skepticism be raised over this
questioning of the existence of the individual. Should he
find reason for holding that he does not exist in the sense
indicated, there will in that fact be no derogation from the
reality of what does exist. On the contrary, there will be
increased recognition of reality. For the individual can be
banished only by showing a plus of existence, not by
alleging a minus. If the individual falls it will be because
the real life of men, when it is widely enough investigated,
proves too rich for him, not because it proves too poverty-
stricken.9

One has only to look at the lively and varied features and the
wide-awake eyes of Chinese and Japanese paintings of the
Great Zen masters to see that the ideal of personality here shown is anything but the collective nonentity or the weakling
ego dissolving back into the womb.

Our mistake has been to suppose that the individual is
honored and his uniqueness enhanced by emphasizing his
separation from the surrounding world, or his eternal
difference in essence from his Creator. As well honor the hand
by lopping it from the arm! But when Spinoza said that "The
more we know of particular things, the more we know of
God," he was anticipating our discovery that the richer and
more articulate our picture of man and of the world becomes,
the more we are aware of its relativity and of the
interconnection of all its patterns in an undivided whole. The
psychotherapist is perfectly in accord with the ways of
liberation in describing the goal of therapy as individuation
(Jung), self-actualization (Maslow), functional autonomy
(Allport), or creative selfhood (Adler), but every plant that is
to come to its full fruition must be embedded in the soil, so
that as its stem ascends the whole earth reaches up to the sun.

II. SOCIETY AND SANITY



    T
    hough it cannot as yet be shown that a society is a body
    of people in the same way that a man is a body of cells,
    it is clear that any social group is something more than the
    sum of its members. People do not live in mere juxtaposition.
    To sum is to collect things together in a one-to-one
    correspondence with a series of numbers, and the relationship
    between 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 is so simple that it does not begin
    to resemble the relationship of people living together. A
    society is people living together in a certain pattern of
    behavior — a pattern which makes such physical traces as
    roads and the structure of towns, codes of law and language,
    tools and artifacts, all of which lay down "channels"
    determining the future behavior of the group. Moreover, a
    society is not "made up" of people in the same way that a
    house is composed of bricks, or even in the same way that an
    army is gathered together by recruitment. Strictly speaking,
    society is not so much a thing as a process of action which is     really indistinguishable from human beings and animals, and
    from life itself. That no human organism exists without male
    and female parents is already society. 


    As a pattern of behavior, society is above all a system of
    people in communication maintained by consistent action. To
    keep the system going, what is done has to be consistent with
    what has been done. The pattern is recognizable as a pattern
    because it goes ahead with reference to its own past; it is just
    this that establishes what we call order and identity, a situation
    in which trees do not suddenly turn into rabbits and in which
    one man does not suddenly behave like another so that we do
    not know who he is. "Who" is consistent behavior. System,
    pattern, coherence, order, agreement, identity, and consistency
    are all in a way synonymous. But in a pattern so mobile and
    volatile as human society, maintaining consistency of action
    and communication is not easy. It requires the most elaborate
    agreements as to what the pattern is, or, to put it in another
    way, as to what are the rules, the consistencies, of the system. Without agreement as to the rules of playing together there is no game. Without agreement as to the use of words, signs, and gestures there is no communication.

The maintenance of society would be simple enough if human beings were content just to survive. In this case they would be simply animals, and it would be enough to eat, sleep, and reproduce. But if these are their basic needs, human beings go about getting them in the most complicated way imaginable. If what must be done to survive is work, it would seem that the main concern of human beings is to play, yet at the same time pretending that most of such play is work.

When one comes to think of it, the boundary between work and play is vague and changeable. Both are work in the sense that they expend energy; but if work is what must be done to survive, may we not ask, "But is it really necessary to survive? Is not survival, the continuation of the consistent pattern of the organism, a form of play?" We must be careful of the anthropomorphism which asserts that animals hunt and cat in order to survive, or that a sunflower turns in order to keep its face to the sun. There is no scientific reason to suppose that there are such things as instincts for survival or for pleasure. When we say that an organism likes to go on living, or that it goes on living because it likes it, what evidence is there for this "like" except that it does in fact go on living - until it doesn't? Similarly, to say that we always choose what we prefer says no more than that we always choose what we choose. If there is a basic urge to live, there must also, as Freud thought, be a basic urge to die. But language and thought are cleaner without these ghostly instincts, urges, and necessities. As Wittgenstein says, "A necessity for one thing to happen because another has happened does not exist. There is only logical necessity."10

An enduring organism is simply one that is consistent with its environment. Its climate and its food agree with it; its pattern assimilates them, eliminating what does not agree, and this consistent motion, this transformation of food and air into the pattern of the organism, is what we call its existence. There is no mysterious necessity for this to continue or discontinue.
To say that the organism needs food is only to say that it is food. To say that it eats because it is hungry is only to say that it eats when it is ready to eat. To say that it dies because it cannot find food is only another way of saying that its death is the same thing as its ceasing to be consistent with the environment. The so-called causal explanation of an event is only the description of the same event in other words. To quote Wittgenstein again, "At the basis of the whole modern view of the world lies the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena."11

More complex organisms, such as human beings, are more complex consistencies, more complex transformations of the environment. Not only are they patterns of transforming food, but their agreement or consistency with the environment changes nuclear vibrations into sound and light, weight and color, taste and smell, temperature and texture, until finally they generate elaborate patterns of signs and symbols of great interior consistency. When these mesh with the environment it becomes possible to describe the world in terms of sign patterns. The world is thus transformed into thought in the same way that food was transformed into body. The agreement or consistency of body pattern or thought pattern with the pattern of the world goes on as long as it goes on. To say why it starts or stops is only to describe particular consistencies or inconsistencies.

To say that there is no necessity for things to happen as they do is perhaps another way of saying that the world is play. But this idea is an affront to common sense because the basic rule of human societies is that one must be consistent. If you want to belong to our society, you must play our game — or, simply, if we are going to be consistent, we must be consistent. The conclusion is substituted for the premise. But this is understandable because, as we have seen, human society is so complex and volatile that consistency is difficult to maintain. Children keep slipping out of the patterns of behavior that we try to impose upon them, and for this and similar reasons our social conventions have to be maintained by force. The first
rule of the game, put in another way, is that the game must
continue, that the survival of the society is necessary. But we
must not lose sight of the fact that the consistencies or
regularities of nature are patterns that do occur, not patterns
that must occur. Natural events do not obey commandments in
the same way that human beings obey the law.*

Or put in still other words, the first rule of the game is that
this game is serious, i.c., is not a game. This might be called
the primordial "repression." By this I do not mean that it is an
event at the temporal beginnings of human life, but rather that
it may be our most deeply ingrained social attitude. But just as
soon as we feel that certain things, such as survival, are serious
necessities, life becomes problematic in a very special sense
quite different from, say, the problems of chess or of science.
Life and problem become the same; the human situation
becomes a predicament for which there is no solution. Man
then behaves as a self-frustrating organism, and this behavior
can be seen in many different ways. For example, one of our
greatest assets for survival is our sense of time, our
marvelously sensitive memory, which enables us to predict the
future from the pattern of the past. Yet awareness of time
ceases to be an asset when concern for the future makes it
almost impossible to live fully in the present, or when
increasing knowledge of the future makes it increasingly
certain that beyond a brief span we have no future. If, too,
man's growing sensitivity requires that he become more and
more aware of himself as an individual, if social institutions
are designed more and more to foster the unique person, not
only are we in great danger of overpopulating but also we are
betting and concentrating upon man in his most vulnerable and
impermanent form.*

This self-frustrating activity is samsara, the vicious circle
from which the ways of liberation propose release. Release
depends upon becoming aware of that primordial repression
which is responsible for the feeling that life is a problem, that
it is serious, that it must go on. It has to be seen that the problem we are trying to solve is absurd. But this means far more than mere resignation to fate, far more than the stoic despair of recognizing that human life is a losing battle with the chaos of nature. That would amount only to seeing that the problem has no solution. We should then simply withdraw from it and sit aloof in a kind of collective psychosis. The point is not that the problem has no solution, but that it is so meaningless that it need not be felt as a problem. To quote Wittgenstein again:

For an answer which cannot be expressed the question too cannot be expressed. The riddle does not exist. If a question can be put at all, then it can also be answered... .For doubt can only exist where there is a question; a question only where there is an answer, and this only where something can be said. We feel that even if all possible scientific questions be answered, the problems of life have still not been touched at all. Of course there is then no question left, and just this is the answer. The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this problem. (Is not this the reason why men to whom after long doubting the sense of life became clear, could not then say wherein this sense consisted?)12

When a psychiatrist asked a Zen master how he dealt with neurotic people he replied, "I trap them!" "And just how do you trap them?" "I get them where they can't ask any more questions!"

But the idea that human life need not be felt as a problem is so unfamiliar and seemingly implausible that we must go more deeply into the social origins of the problematic feeling. In the first place, the opposition of human order to natural chaos is false. To say that there is no natural necessity is not to say that there is no natural order, no pattern or consistency, in the physical world. After all, man himself is part of the physical world, and so is his logic. But it should not be hard to see that the kind of order which we call logical or causal necessity is a subtype of order, a kind of order which appears in the world but is not characteristic of it as a whole. Similarly, the order of the rational integers 1, 2, 3, etc., is in the world,
but mathematics would be a poor tool for describing the world
if it were confined to simple arithmetic. We could say that the
order of probability describes the world better than the order
of causality. This is the same sort of truth as that a man with a
saw can cut wood better than a man with a stone ax. The world
is to us as we have means of assimilating it: patterns of
thought-language in whose terms we can describe it. Yet these
patterns are physical events, just as much as those which they
describe. The point is surely that the world has no fixed order.
We could almost say that the world is ordering itself ever more
subtly both by means of and as the behaviors of living
organisms.

We saw that primitive organisms consist with their
environments by the transformation of food, etc., into the
patterns of their bodies. This can be put the other way around
by saying that environments consist with organisms by being
of such a nature that this is possible. Ecologists speak of the
evolution of the environment as well as the evolution of the
organism. As Dewey and Bentley,13 Angyal,14 Brunswik,15
and many others have suggested, organism/environment is a
unified pattern of behavior somewhat like a field in physics —
not an interaction but a transaction. As Gardner Murphy has
put it:

We cannot define the situation operationally except in
relation to the specific organism which is involved; we
cannot define the organism operationally...except in
reference to the situation. Each serves to define the
other.16

To define operationally is to say what happens, to describe
behavior, and as soon as we do this we find that we are talking
about transactions. We cannot describe movements without
describing the area or space in which they occur; we would not
know that a given star or galaxy was moving except by
comparing its position with others around it. Likewise, when
we describe the world as completely as we can, we find that we are describing the form of man, for the scientific
description of the world is actually a description of
experiments, of what men do when they investigate the world.
Conversely, when we describe the form of man as completely
as we can — his physical structure as well as his behavior in
speech and action — we find that we are describing the world.
There is no way of separating them except by not looking too
carefully, that is, by ignorance.

The human behavior that we call perception, thought,
speech, and action is a consistency of organism and
environment of the same kind as eating. What happens when
we touch and feel a rock? Speaking very crudely, the rock
comes in touch with a multitude of nerve ends in our fingers,
and any nerve in the whole pattern of ends which touches the
rock "lights up." Imagine an enormous grid of electric
lightbulbs connected with a tightly packed grid of push
buttons. If I open my hand and with its whole surface push
down a group of buttons, the bulbs will light up in a pattern
approximately resembling my hand. The shape of the hand is
"translated" into the pattern of buttons and bulbs. Similarly,
the feeling of a rock is what happens in the "grid" of the
nervous system when it translates a contact with the rock. But
we have at our disposal "grids" far more complex than this —
not only optical and auditory but also linguistic and
mathematical. These, too, are patterns into whose terms the
world is translated in the same way as the rock is translated
into nerve patterns. Such a grid, for example, is the system of
coordinates, three of space and one of time, in which we feel
that the world is happening even though there are no actual
lines of height, width, and depth filling all space, and though
the earth does not go ticktock when it revolves. Such a grid is
also the whole system of classes, or verbal pigeonholes, into
which we sort the world as things or events; still or moving;
light or dark; animal, vegetable, or mineral; bird, beast, or
flower; past, present, or future.

It is obvious, then, that when we are talking about the
order and structure of the world, we are talking about the order of our grids. "Laws, like the law of causation, etc., treat of the

network and not of what the network describes."17 In other

words, what we call the regularities of nature are the

regularities of our grids. For regularity cannot be noticed

except by comparing one process with another — e.g., the

rotation of the earth about the sun with the strictly measured

rotation of the clock. (The clock, with its evenly spaced

seconds and minutes, is here the grid.) In the same way, what

appear to be necessities of nature as a whole may be no more

than necessities of grammar or mathematics. When anyone

says that an unsupported body which is heavier than air

necessarily falls to the ground, the necessity is not in nature

but in the rules of definition. If it did not fall to the ground, it

would not fit what we mean by "heavier than air." Consider

the way in which a great deal of mathematical thinking is

actually done. The mathematician does not ask whether his

constructions are applicable, whether they correspond to any

constructions in the natural world. He simply goes ahead and

invents mathematical forms, asking only that they be

consistent with themselves, with their own postulates. But

every now and then it subsequently turns out that these forms

can be correlated, like clocks, with other natural processes.

The puzzling thing is that some of the "grids" which we

invent work, and some do not. In the same way, some animal

behaviors seem to fit the environment and some do not. Those

of ants, for example, have remained stable for millions of

years, but the huge fangs of the saber-toothed tiger, the vast

bulk of the Sauria, and the great nose horns of the

Titanotheriidae were experimental failures. It would perhaps

be more exact to say that they worked for a while, but not for

as long as the experiments of other species. But what seems to

happen in most of these cases is that the

organism/environment relationship "splits": the organism's

attack upon or defense against the environment becomes too

strong, so isolating it from its source of life. Or it may be that

the organism is too conservative for a swiftly changing

environment, which is really the same situation: the pattern is

too rigid, too insistent on survival, and thus again isolated. Or it may be that the organism, considered as a field in itself, is in
self-contradiction: the weight of the nose horn is too much for
the muscles. Turning to the human species, we may wonder
whether such a split is taking place in the development of the
overisolated consciousness of the individual.

If this be so, we must be careful of a false step in
reasoning. We must not say to the individual, "Watch out! If
you want to survive you must do something about it!" Any
action along these lines will simply make things worse; it will
simply confirm the individual in his feeling of separation. It
will become, like the nose horn, a survival mechanism
frustrating survival. But if it is not up to the individual to do
something, what is there to be said or done, and to whom and
by whom?

Is it entirely unreasonable to suppose that the situation may
correct itself, that the "field pattern" man/universe may be
intelligent enough to do so? If this happens, or is happening, it
will at first appear that individuals are initiating the changes
on their own. But as the required change takes place, the
individuals involved will simultaneously undergo a change of
consciousness revealing the illusion of their isolation. May not
something of the same kind be happening when a research
worker, thinking that he has made an independent discovery,
learns to his astonishment that several other people hit upon it
at about the same time? As scientists sometimes say, the field
of research had developed to the point where this particular
discovery might naturally break out at several places.*

If we turn now to the social institution of language, or the
"grid of words," we can easily see the ways in which it may be
splitting organism from environment, and aspects of the environment from one another. Languages with such parts of
speech as nouns and verbs obviously translate what is going
on in the world into particular things (nouns) and events
(verbs), and these in turn "have" properties (adjectives and
adverbs) more or less separable from them. All such languages
represent the world as if it were an assemblage of distinct bits
and particles. The defect of such grids is that they screen out
